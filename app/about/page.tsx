          I started code at 2020, back then i was a nutrition student but really
          unhappy with my carrer choice, but then i started coding as a hobbie
          and later on became my passion, my first language was C as every
          single suffer CS student, but then i started to learn Javascript and
          fell in love, had some breafing contact in my College and get deeper
          on docs and online courses, Since always i have been working with web
          development
        </p>
        <p>
          Since i get passionate about the javascript ecossistem, i get my
          knowledge realy deeper into NodeJS and also NextJS, i always wanted to
          be a fullstack developer
        </p>
        <p>
          When i not coding,i&apos;m probably playling volleyball, in the gym or
          even studying a little bit about finance
